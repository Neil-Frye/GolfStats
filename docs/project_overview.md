# GolfStats Project Overview

## Vision
The GolfStats project aims to provide golfers with a comprehensive platform to track and analyze their performance data from various sources, including Trackman, Arccos, and Skytrak. The platform will integrate data scraping, ETL processes, and visualization tools to offer insights into a golfer's game.

2. **Data Processing**: Perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations to clean and standardize the data.
3. **Data Storage**: Store processed data in a database for easy access and analysis.
4. **Data Visualization**: Provide a user-friendly interface for visualizing golf statistics and trends.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Handles data scraping, ETL processes, and database management.
- **Frontend**: Provides a user interface for data visualization.
- **Config**: Contains configuration settings for the application.
- **Tests**: Unit and integration tests for the application.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with Tableau for advanced data visualization.
- User authentication and personalized dashboards.
- Mobile app for on-the-go access to golf statistics.
